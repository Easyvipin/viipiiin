# OBJECTS

Object stored collection of key value pairs and complex entities.

```jsx
Object literal declaration

let person = {
key : value
```

### Access of properties

Dot :

Person.name

Bracket :

```jsx
const person = {
  name: "vipin",
  "full name": "vipin chandra",
};
person.name;
person["full name"];
```

### Method to get keys ,values , entries

Object.keys , Object.values , Object.entries Returns an array of property ,values , property:values

But they don't read a property from prototype object.

Whereas For in Loop does read.
