Everything is created from some event even our **Universe** and the little **Browser Popup**.

**_What is an event ?_**
It is an occurrence of different activities, right?

### Events in Browser

There are different type of action that are performed on dom are called events

Some events as follows

- click
- keyup/keydown
- Mouseover/out

The function which executes when a certain event occur is called **Event Handler**

and this is how we write event handlers in a different ways.

```
1. <button id="btn" onClick="alert('clicked')">Click</button>

2.  <button id="btn">Click</button>
    <script>
      btn.onclick = function () {
        console.log("clicked");
      };
    </script>

```

I hope it was a good review of the basics.

**_But do you know how dom reacts when events happen on an element?_**

```
 <section onClick="alert('i am section')">
      <div onClick="alert('i am div')">
        <p onClick="alert('i am p')">click me</p>
      </div>
    </section>

```

Now if the user click on the p element all three alert box will pop up.
Bit strange right?

This is called a **Bubbling effect**.

**_Whenever an event happens it runs an event handler on that element, then on the parent element and then all the way to root elements._**

Detailed Points of what will happen if the user click on the `p` element

1. A `p` element event handler will run which is `onclick` and then the Browser will generate an alert box displaying **_i am p_**.
2. If the parent element contains the same event handler then the parent element handler will also execute.
3. In this case div contains the same event handler `onclick` so that handler will be called too.
4. This process continues to the root element.
5. Thus, the section element event handler also generate an alert box.
6. This Bubble effect will end on the `document` object.

This bubbling effect works like a bubble that is created when a stone or a raindrop fall on lakes.

**_Every event show bubble effect except some few instances_**

To check if the event show bubble effect

`event.bubbles` will return a boolean value

### Stop a Bubbling effect

There are two functions which can stop a bubble effect

`event.stopPropagation()`- stop the handler of current element
and restrict the bubble effect.

```
   <section onClick="alert('section')">
       <div onClick="alert('div')">
         <p onClick="event.stopPropagation()">click me</p>
       </div>
     </section>
  <!-- no alert box will generate -->

```

`event.stopImmediatePropagation()` - If the current element has
more handler on same event.

```
 <section onClick="alert('section')">
       <div onClick="alert('div')">
         <p onClick="event.stopImmediatePropagation()"
         onClick="alert('second hanlder')">click me</p>
       </div>
     </section>
  <!-- no alert box will generate -->

```

Although Developers avoid the restriction on the bubble effect because it can lead to some large pitfalls.

Think and comment down some examples of pitfalls.
