According to ECMAScript2015(Es6), new functionalities were added to JavaScript.

Most of the new methods were added for arrays.
In this article, we will explore some of them.

## `.from( )`

This function returns a copy of the array `without copying the reference of the given array`.

Generally, In Array whenever we make a copy of the array the
reference remains the same for the new copied array .

Because of this behaviour any changes to duplicate array also
reflect on the original one.

Example :

```javascript
let no = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
let copyno = no; // copy of no
console.log(copyno); // [2,3,4,5,6]
// adding '10' at 0 index of copyno
copyno[0] = 10; // this will also be reflected on no array.
console.log(no); //[10,3,4,5,6]
```

But `.from()` alter this kind of behaviour.

`let copyarr = Array.from(originalArray)`

Example :

```javascript
let count = [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13];
let count2 = Array.from(count);
count2[8] = 14;
console.log(count);
/* [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13] remain unchanged*/
console.log(count2);
/* [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14] */
```

We can also pass a callback function to `.from()`

```javascript
let even = Array.from(count, (x) => x % 2 == 0);
console.log(even);
/* [true, true, false, true, false, true, false, false] */
```

## `.enteries( )`

This function returns an iterable object which contains key:value
pairs.

`let allEntry = arr.enteries()`

```javascript
let numbers = new Array(2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
let aEnteries = numbers.entries();
console.log(aEnteries.next().value);
console.log(aEnteries.next().value);
/* [0,2] [1,3] [key,value]*/
```

## `.keys() & .values()`

This both function works the same as .entries().
But `.keys()` return only keys (indexes) and `.values ` return values(element).

```javascript
let count = [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13];

let allKeys = count.keys(); //return object contains keys only
console.log(allKeys.next().value); //0
console.log(allKeys.next().value); //1
console.log(allKeys.next().value); //2

let allValues = count.values();
console.log(allValues.next().value); //2
console.log(allValues.next().value); //4
console.log(allValues.next().value); //5
```

## `.fill( )`

Fill function fills the array with static value at all of the
position by default.

```javascript
let games = ["football", "basket ball", "swimming", "cricket"];
games.fill("football");
console.log(games);
/* ["football", "football", "football", "football"] */
```

To start the filling from a given position we can pass another parameter specifying the starting index.

```javascript
let games = ["football", "basket ball", "swimming", "cricket"];
games.fill("football", 2);
/* ["football", "basket ball", "football", "football"] */
//  0         , 1            , 2          , 3
```

we can also pass the position where we want to end the fillings.
The end index is `inclusive` in filling process.

```javascript
let games = ["football", "basket ball", "swimming", "cricket"];
games.fill("football", 1, 2);
/* ["football", "football", "football", "cricket"] */
//  0         , 1 (start) , 2 (ending) , 3
```

## `includes( )`

This function returns True if the given element is found in the
array and False if not.

`arr.includes(element)`

```javascript
let count = [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13];
console.log(count.includes(7)); // true
console.log(count.includes(14)); //false
```

## `.find( ) & .findIndex( )`

`.find( )` function receives a callback function.

This callback function will loop through all the values and the
first value which satisfies the condition will be returned.

`.findIndexOf( )` function also work like `.find( )` but this
function returns the index of the value.

Example :

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 24];
function multipleOf12(element, index, array) {
  return element % 12 == 0;
}
console.log(numbers.find(multipleOf12));
/* find return the element which first satisfies the condition  thats why we get 12 as output instead of 24*/

console.log(numbers.findIndex(multipleOf12));
/* find return the  index of the element which is 11 in our case */
```
